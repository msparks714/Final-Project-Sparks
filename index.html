        <p><h2><u>Los Angeles</u></h2></p>
            <p>"Los Angeles has an estimated 10,105,722 residents in
              their metropolitan area. 95,902 of those are members of a tribe,
              accounting for .95% of the overall city's population, but that
              is where 21.6% of all Native peoples in California reside.
              For more information about LA, check out their
              <a href="https://www.lacity.org/support-for-residents">City Website<a></p>
          <p><h2><u>Anchorage</u></h2></p>
              <p> Did you know that 15% of all people who live in Alaska are Native?
                Of Anchorage's 298,225 people, 28,751 are Indigenous peoples which means that
                25.2% of all Native people in Alaska actually live in Anchorage. The other
                three-quarter live in small villages dispersed about the state. Zoom in close
                to see individual village names and populations. Learn more about Anchorage
                <a href="https://www.muni.org/pages/default.aspx">here.<a></p>
          <p><h2><u>Oklahoma City</u></h2></p>
            <p> Oklahoma is dervied from a word in the Choctaw language that translates into
              "Red People" and was an attempt to create an all Indian state. Not surprisingly
              only 7.56% of Oklahoma City's residents are Native Americans, as most live on
              reservations and protected lands in the North Western part of the state. To learn
              more about the Tribes in Oklahoma go

          <p><h2><u>Phoenix</u></h2></p>
            <p> Phoenix is another interesting place, as some of the largest tribal areas
              exist in the American Southwest. The Navajo Nation alone has 157,716 residents.
              Of Phoenix's population, 27.93% of urbannites are Native, but that is only 2.11%
              of Native residents of Arizona--meaning most live outside of the city.

          <p><h2><u>New York City</u></h2></p>
            <p> The city of Dreams, some say. The Big Apple boasts the largest number (38,845) of
              Native residents over any other city in the United States. With that being said,
              only .454% of the State identify as Native American, and of that amount, 45.66% live
              in one of the five boroughs. This only means that of the Native peoples in NYS, almost
              half live in <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/">NYC.<a></p>

    <p>This website was created as a final project for a Masters in Urban Planning
    Degree at New York University in Spring 2020 by Mikeala Sparks (MUP). Significant Credit
    and thanks goes to Chris Whong, Professor of the class for a wonderful semester and
    having been such an encouraging and helpful support throughout the process, as well as
    close friends Thomas and Jessica Foulds and their puppy Porter for continually checking
    and cleaning my code, even when it was a disaster. All websites, datasets, and historical
    information is referenced in my code, once you click 'inspect'.
