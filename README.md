# Final-Project-Sparks

This project was a part of the URPL coding class at NYU Wagner School of Public Service Taught by Chris Whong. 
The goal of this map is to showcase where Native American reservations are located and of the top five cities in the 
US who have the largest populations of Native peoples, how that contributes to the population at the state level.
For instance, not a lot of Native People in Oklahoma live in their capital city, this makes sense because maojrity of
Oklahoma has federally recognized land and most Native Americans live on the reservations or tribal property outside
of city centers. This is completely an oppostie story for places like New York City.
